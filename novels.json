The main villain, in this case, is a dark wizard who wants to rule over the world. He is also the only one who can stop the war. In order to accomplish this, he must be stopped. With only two options, a wizard and a war hero, to choose from. Which one would you choose? I thought it a bit unfair, as the wizard was the hero of my story. So I had to ask myself, who was more important, me or the dark knight? But I wasn't sure if I should ask the question at all. If I asked , 'Who is the Dark Knight?' I would probably be accused of being a traitor to my race. A coward, if you will. Or maybe I'd be called a coward as well. Who knew? So, I decided to leave that question open, for now. For now, I just wanted to know. Why did I have to die? I was not a very good student, or at least not one of those students who would get good grades. My teachers were always very harsh, especially in math. When I did well in school, my parents would often send me to the principal's office for being late. So I had to learn to work harder. That was the first step. Then I started to think about what I needed to study. What I really needed was more math and science. Science was what my mother had always taught me and what she had told me I needed to focus on. But I couldn't do math. Math was for the smart ones. Not me! So what did they do? They gave me a science book, which I read for two weeks straight. Then, after that, they sent me off to school.",
